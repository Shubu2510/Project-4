Mobile Price Prediction
For Mobile Price Prediction's i have used EDA, so that further insights can be drawn from this data. 
Here I have done data wrangling, central tendency of the data, finding missing values (None), detection of Outliers and it’s removal, along with correlation of the final data with eachother. 
This correlation shows the price dependecy of the Mobile based on some variables 
e.g.:- (1) General Trend: When memory capacity increases, mobile phone prices also increases. Exceptions: However, there are exceptions. Some phones with relatively lower memory capacities may have higher prices because of other factors such as mobile brand, camera quality, any other unique features.

(2) Camera Quality:-
Positive Correlation: When the camera quality increases, the price of the mobile phone also increases. This suggests that consumers are willing to pay more for better camera specifications.
Variability: While there is a positive trend, there is also significant variability in prices for phones with similar camera quality. Factors such as brand reputation, additional features, and market demand for any particular phone, contribute to this variability.

(3) Battery Capacity (mAh).
Data shows the pattern that higher battery capacity does not necessarily correlate with a higher price. In some phones with lower battery capacities are priced higher than those with larger batteries.

(4) Processors :-  When Processor quality  is increased, the price of the mobile phone also increases.

(5) No any Proper pattern or relation of Mobile Phone’s Prices with Colors and Heights of the Phone.
